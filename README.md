# js-factorial-testing

## Description

This project is a JavaScript application that calculates the factorial of a given number. It provides a factorial function implemented in JavaScript with error handling for negative numbers. Additionally, it includes Jest tests to ensure the correctness of the factorial function. Moreover, it offers a basic HTML interface for users to input a number and see its factorial.

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ozioma45/js-factorial-testing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd js-factorial-testing
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the project in two main ways:

### Running Tests

To run the Jest tests and ensure the factorial function works correctly:

```bash
npm test
```

### Using the HTML Interface

Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and you'll see a simple interface with an input field. Enter a number into the input field, and the factorial of that number will be displayed below.

## Project Structure

- `src/factorial.js`: Contains the JavaScript implementation of the factorial function.
- `src/factorial.test.js`: Jest test file for testing the factorial function.
- `index.html`: HTML file providing a basic interface for users to interact with the factorial function.
- `.babelrc`: Babel configuration file for transpiling JavaScript.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata about the project and manages dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Automatically generated file for npm dependency resolution.
